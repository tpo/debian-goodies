debian-goodies (0.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * [checkrestart] 
     - Prover fix to avoid false positives due to /drm (Closes: #548380)
     - Add patch provided by Tollef Fog Heen which includes a new -b
       (blacklist) option. This makes it possible for system
       administrators to prevent false positives or known issues
       from reports (Closes: #649168, 632032)
     - Fix behaviour of the -p option in several ways to both ensure that the
       test is done properly and that it does not consume unnecesary CPU
       resources. Also process STDERR instead of showing its contents to the
       end-user. (Closes: #657653, #513189)
     - The -p option now works also when libraries have been upgraded and the
       files in use are no longer present in the file system.
     - Do not abort if running in a vserver environment. In these environments
       the init system (i.e PID 1) is unaccessible. (Closes: 674296)
     - Introduce a -i option to make it possible to ignore a given set of
       packages from the output
     - Add util-linux and screen to the default ignorelist since these
       packages' initscripts are no-op (Closes: #673045)
     - Fix reading of dpkg-query process which can deadlock due to buffering
       when --query is given too many arguments or --listfiles returns a long
       list of items
     - Improve handling of interpreted files using patch provided by Guillaume
       Delacour and Michal Fiala (Closes: #657087)
  * [debget] 
     - Allow error in apt calls since those are handled by the script 
       (Closes: 676715)

       #592436, thanks Jörg Sommer)
  * [bash_completion]
     - Install debmany bash completion file to /etc/bash_completion.d
       instead of as example. Rename it for easier use of dh_install.
     - Add bash package name completion for which-pkg-broke (Closes:
       #641877), dhomepage, and debget. (Based on devscript's package name
       completion which is under GPLv2+, too)
  * Fix the following lintian warnings:
    - copyright-refers-to-symlink-license
    - debian-rules-missing-recommended-target
  * Thanks Jakub Wilk for many bugfix patches!

  * [checkrestart]: 
     - Exclude /run/ from the deleted files check, this prevents 
       false positives from some programs such as newer releases of
       jackd2 and chromium which use /run/shm/ instead of
       /dev/shm/ (Closes: #595096)

debian-goodies (0.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * [checkrestart]: 
     - Use patch provided by Jörg Sommer and Piotr Kaczuba that makes the
       script use a set for the initscripts information, thus making the
       program work with Python 2.7 (Closes: #643977)
     - Fix behaviour of -p so that it does not consider files that do
       not belong to any package, thanks to Peter Eisentraut for the
       patch. (Closes: #608387)
     - Fix handling of --verbose option (Closes: #623168)
     - Exclude /dev/shm/ from the deleted files check, this prevents 
       a false positive from some programs such as jackd2 (Closes: #595096)
     - Exclude /home from the deleted files check as these
       generate a number of false positives. This included: GNOME's mixer
       applet, dovecot, nautilus, chromium-broswer and evolution-data-server
       (Closes: #595096, #609454)
  * [checkrestart.1]:

debian-goodies (0.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Turn the lsof Depends: into Recommends for the benefit
    of the kfreebsd architectures (i.e. to make it possible for it to be
    installed in these as lsof is not available there). Unfortunately,
    we cannot use a Depends based on architecture as we are Arch: all
    (Closes: #594431)
  * [checkrestart]: Complain if lsof is not installed (could happen since
    it is now in Recommends) and abort as we do not currently have
    an alternative (psdel still unfinished...)
  * [checkrestart]: Fix false positive with Xorg in some specific Xorg
    servers due to the use of /drm. Thanks to Tarek Soliman for the patch.
    (Closes: 548380)
  * [dglob, dglob.pod]: Use grep-aptavail when the user requests all packages
    listed. Also use apt-file if available since if the package is not
    installed then the list of files is not available in the system
    (Closes: #594426)
  * Include a new 'debpaste' which is borrowed from http://paste.debian.net
    (more specifically http://ankh-morp.org/~vetinari/tools/paste-dn.pl).
    Adjust debian/copyright accordingly to acknowledge the author and
    its copyright. This script is not yet distributed as Recommends/Depends
    have to be adjusted to accommodate it, and a manpage needs to be written,
    but it will be used as a basis to coses bug #476099.

    multiple packages due to missing dependencies. Thanks Jakub Wilk for
    the patch! (Closes: #536377, #522491)
  * dpigs: New option -H which outputs human-readable packages sizes
    similar to "ls -lh" or "du -h" (Closes: #307910)
  * Updated dpigs documentation to match current command line options.
  * Fixed deprecation warning in which-pkg-broke with Python 2.6 by using
    the subprocess instead of popen2 module. Thanks Jakub Wilk for the
    patch! (Closes: #582924)
  * Added which-pkg-broke to the package's long description (Closes: #563279)
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.4 (no changes other than those
    mentioned elsewhere in the changelog entry)

  * Include patch from Jiri Palecek that makes checkrestart work
  with processes that lack a proper link /proc/$PID/exe. This seems to happen
  with UML processes and confused the program. (Closes: 522850)
  * Include patches provided by Joerg Sommer for checkrestart:
  (Closes: 511537) 
     -  Set locale to POSIX ('C') since the output of dpkg is localized and
        localisations makes the match for diversions fail.
     - Skip the last output line from diversions since it is a summary
       listing packages that are part of a diversion.
     - Use dpkg-query instead of dpkg since dpkg-query is the generic interface
       for querying the dpkg database is dpkg-query, and dpkg is only a 
       wrapper for it.
     - Removed useless check in the isdeletedFile function that covers
       mutt in /tmp since there is already a match for /tmp
  * checkrestart: don't complain about processes that have deleted files
    in /var/tmp

  * checkrestart:

    not seem to like lists in os.popen and because subprocess is preferable
    here.
    - Recode the utility so that the checks for deleted files and descriptors
    is not duplicated.
    - Remove the (useless) check for deleted descriptor
    - Rewrite the handling of lsof results to be more accurate and
    understandable.
    - Add a 'verbose' option that makes it list all the (supposedly) deleted
    files and descriptors used by the processes (Closes: #466811, #475397) -
    Add icon-theme.cache  to the list of deleted files that will be flagged

        task-scheduling tool.

  * checkrestart changes:
    * Do not warn on processes than use /dev/zero and shows up as
      deleted. This prevents it from warning about apache2 (Closes: #432569)
    * Slightly improve the messages output.
    * Find init.d scripts even if not provided in the package by looking
      for init.d scripts that match the process name (works for apache2 too)
  * Fix some typos in which-pkg-broke(1) (Closes: #409581)

debian-goodies (0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patch by Francesco Potorti that makes checkrestart list 
    processes that should be restarted when a daemon is restarted.
    This helps warn users that some processes will not be restarted
    even though they use the init script (such as active ssh connections). And
    need to be restarted manually (Closes: #290265)
  * Be more verbose when nothing needs to be done (the user might think that
    the script did not do anything!)

debian-goodies (0.27) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Fixes I would like to see in etch, even though we're on freeze now ]
  * Fix checkrestart with patch provided by Justin Pryzby, modify to reduce
    false positives by not complaining about deleted inodes/files under
    /tmp/, /var/log/ or named /SYSV. This fixes the long-standing issue that
    made this script rather useless (related to lsof, see bug #297029, and to
    changes in dpkg)  (Closes: #264985)
    (Note I have included the code from Sam Morris, available at
    http://robots.org.uk/src/psdel and contributed in the BTS. But it still
    needs to be massaged to work as a replacement for lsof)
  * Write a manpage for checkrestart so administrators are aware that this  
    tool should not be completely relied on. (Closes: #305279)
  * Update the version of network-test which fixes some of the bugs already
    fixed in the experimental 'ifupdown-extra' package:
    [ Note: Post-etch network-test will be removed from this package but
      I rather not try to introduce an experimental package such as
      ifupdown-extra into etch right now ]
      * Make network-test use bash (Closed: #401363)
      * Do not analyse resolv.conf lines that have been commented out.
      * Change network-test so it does not complain loudly if ethtool is not
        installed (just recommends its installation)
      * Fix duplicate spaces in the script as well as some typos with patch
        provided by Norbert Kiesel (Closed: #400463)
      * Change behaviour of network-test when testing ethernet link 
        (based on ifupdown-extra's 'check-network-cable' tests) this is better
        (and more reliable) than just using 'ifconfig' but requires users
        install additional software.

    - correctly detects an interface as UP if it has been forced to a
      given speed (Closes: #396336)

  * Taking up this package as new maintainer, after talking with Matt
    on private mail.
  * Fix Frank Lichtenheld's mail in all manpages (Closes: #249818)
  * Changes to debget:
    - debget --help (or -h) now works as expected. Introduce usage
      in the tool to warn on errors when calling it (Closes: #251353)
    - Any other options are rejected (as they would be passed on to apt)
    - Additional error checking in debget to prevent it from going ahead
      when something goes wrong, this includes checking first if the
      apt-get dependencies are right and that the package the user asked
      us to retrieve exists (Closes: #283401)
    - Use apt-cache instead of apt-get to get the version as
      'apt-get -q2 -s --reinstall install' requires, for some reason,
      super cower powers. This makes it possible to download packages
      without satisfying dependencies (Closes: #369494)
    - Document the fact that downloading packages from the package cache
      is not supported both in the manpage and in the program's output
      (Closes: #224857)
  * Fix manpage dglob typos as well as the header of the documentation
    generated by pod2man (Closes #228302, #305802)
  * Have debman use bash as a shell (Closes: #369762)
  * Set LC_NUMERIC to 'C' in dpigs as suggested by Bill Allombert (Closes:
    #368227)
  * Move checkrestart to /usr/sbin (Closes: #329723)
  * Have dglob exit with a '1' exit status if no packages match the globbing
    pattern (Closes: #292585)
  * Make popbugs properly extract the file provided by the user instead of
    /var/log/popularity-contest, if requested to (Closes: #263471)
  * Fix typo in popbugs.1 manpage (AUTOR -> AUTHOR)
  * Include which-pkg-broke Python script contributed by Bill Gribble and
    wrote its associated manpage (Closes: #231470)
  * Include network-test shell script contributed by myself and
    wrote its associated manpage (Closes: #307694)
